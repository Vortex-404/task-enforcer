# StrictFocus Elite â€” UI/UX Changes (summary)

Applied: Visual polish, interaction improvements, environment safety, local persistence and toast feedback.

Files changed / added:
- src/index.css
  - Consolidated HSL tokens, mode overrides ([data-mode="ceo"/"casual"]).
  - Added component utility classes: .btn, .deploy-btn, .card, .input, .tabs, .toast, .local-sync.
  - Added animations: sf-float-up, sf-celebrate and reduced-motion support.

- tailwind.config.ts
  - Linked Tailwind colors/radii to CSS vars, added keyframes and animations.

- src/components/ui/button.tsx
  - Added primary gradient variant, rounded-xl, hover scale and sizes.

- src/components/ui/card.tsx
  - Use card utility classes for glass panel, rounded-2xl and consistent header/content.

- src/components/ui/badge.tsx
  - Pill badges with variants (outline, primary).

- src/components/ui/tabs.tsx
  - Tabs primitives with active styling.

- src/components/ui/input.tsx
  - Rounded inputs and focus ring.

- src/components/CalendarView.tsx
  - Removed embedded Supabase secret; use env vars centrally (create client elsewhere).
  - Use .deploy-btn class on Add Task button and mark data-redirect="true".

- src/pages/Index.tsx
  - Lightweight toast provider, localStorage-based immediate task persistence, toast feedback and redirect to /deploy on create.

Notes & Recommendations:
- Replace any embedded secrets with environment variables:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- Consider centralizing the Supabase client createClient in src/lib/supabase.ts and import it.
- Replace local toast with react-hot-toast or a global context for richer behaviour.
- Add a /deploy route or component to accept deploy actions; CalendarView Add Task currently redirects to /deploy.
- Review all other components to use the new CSS utility classes (.btn, .card, .input, etc.) for consistency.

If you want, I can:
- Wire a central supabase client file that reads env vars and update imports.
- Replace the minimal toast UI with react-hot-toast and theme it.
- Add a /deploy page scaffold and ensure client-side routing (Next/router) is used when applicable.
